# BMBF-Log-interpreter
A console application that filters the most important information of a BMBF Log.
# Info
This time no automatic update or update checking xD. I want a bit less work.
# Usage
Just open the program and then select the BMBF log (you can get it from `/sdcard/BMBFservice.log` on your Quest). Then say at which line you want to start checking (default: 0)
